# 1. Running the app

The `demo` folder contains all the code for the project.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a framework for writing quick apps in Python.

That makes it perfect for building our personal assistant.

## Running the Streamlit app

To run the Streamlit app, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run demo/main.py
```

or

```bash
make start-streamlit-app
```

## Use the app

If all has gone well you will now be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8501` and see your very own chatbot.

Try and ask it some questions.

Is it connected to the internet? 

How up to date is it's knowledge?
